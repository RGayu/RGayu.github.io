# About

I'm a cybersecurity engineer looking forward to exploring pen testing, application security, and securing computer systems. I'm currently pursuing MS in Cybersecurity ag Georgia  I'm an enthusiastic and curious person always looking for new opportunities to learn and meet new people. I'm an avid reader, mystery and thriller are my favorite genre. Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot are always competing for the best detective position in my heart.

# Publications

#### A Machine Learning Framework for Domain Generating Algorithm based Malware Detection
Wiley Security and Privacy
https://doi.org/10.1002/spy2.127
Created a machine learning framework for real-time detection of DGA generated domain names. Models Used: SVM, J48, Logistic regression, Gradient Boosting Tree, DBSCAN, OPTICS

# Projects

#### Establishing Trusted Communication Channels in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) - Current
Create a Key exchange mechanism that ensures confidentiality and authenticity. Manage the overhead while adding security mechanisms 

#### Simulation of BGP Hijacking
Simulated a BGP Hijacking attack using Mininet

#### Buffer Overflow attack
Simulated a stack buffer overflow attack. Simulated a return-to-libc overflow attack

#### Location based Advertisement Delivery using Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs)
Simulated a VANET using NS2 that is capable of delivering the advertisements to users . Used location to deliver advertisement from vendors that are closer. Incorporated user preference using machine learning algorithm

#### Intelligent Traffic Management System 
Developed a web application that gathers live traffic data from Twitter feed. Suggested the shortest route based on the distance, time taken and traffic delays

#### Semantic Segmentation of Cooking Videos
Used Differential Evolution to extract key frames from a video. Created a dataset and a model for identification of Indian ingredients. Output is a video made from the extracted key frames
